            Use a knife to make slits 2 inches or 5 cm apart on the goat leg.
            Transfer the meat to a bowl and toss it with half of the marinade.
            Set the other marinade aside, to be used in basting the nyama
            choma.Gashes on the surface of goat meat, in preparation for
            marination.
          </li>

        <p><i>How to marinate goat meat for grilling</i></p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Remove the marinated goat meat from the fridge and allow it to come
            to room temperature for at least an hour, before setting it on the
            barbecue. During this time, prepare your grill and set it to high.
            Cover your grill with ashes if using a charcoal grill, to prevent it
            from getting too hot.
          </li>
          <li>
            Rub a few tablespoons of oil on a piece of aluminum foil then set it
            aside. Grill the meat on high for approximately 3 minutes on each
            side, or until it attains a proper color then transfer it to the
            prepared aluminum foil. Top it with the reserved marinade, then add
            more layers of aluminum foil at the bottom, so you end up with a
            triple layer.
          </li>
          <li>
            Place two sprigs of rosemary and the bulb of garlic on top of the
            goat leg. Cover the meat loosely with foil so it resembles a tent.
          </li>
          <li>
            Add some water to a baking tray and place the meat on top of the
            baking tray. Transfer it to the barbecue grill then cover the lid,
            trying to maintain the temperature at medium-low. Grill for one and
            a half hours, turning from time to time.
          </li>
          <li>
            Once the time is up and the meat is almost done, mix the honey with
            2-3 tablespoons of hot water to make a glaze. Uncover the meat and
            baste it with the honey glaze. Continue to grill for a further 15-30
            minutes or until the desired brownness has been achieved and the
            juices run clear, or it has an internal temperature of at least
            150-160 degrees F.
          </li>

          <li>
            Once cooked, transfer the meat to a tray and allow it to rest for
            10-20 minutes before carving. Serve nyama choma with ugali, sukuma
            wiki, and kachumbari, or your favourite dishes.

        </ol>
        <p><i>Oven method</i></p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            To make nyama choma in the oven, simply marinate the meat and cover
            it with aluminum foil in preparation for roasting, as per the
            instructions above. Next, preheat the oven to 170° C/ 365° F
            (standard) or 150° C fan then lay the meat on a baking tray. Place
            in the oven and slowly roast for 4.5 hours.
          </li>
          <li>
            Once the cooking time is over, get the meat out of the oven and
            remove the aluminum foil. Make the glaze by mixing honey with 2-3
            tablespoons of hot water. Uncover the meat and baste it with the
            honey glaze.
          </li>
          <li>
            Return the basted meat to the oven and broil each side on high for
            5-10 minutes, or until the desired level of browness has been
            obtained.
          </li>
          <li>
            Remove the meat from the oven and allow it to cool for 20 minutes,
            before carving to prevent the juices from running out.
          </li>
          <li>
            Serve the nyama choma with mukimo, ugali, kachumbari or your
            favorite side dish.
