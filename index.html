<h1>ELECTRIC CARS</h1>
<P>An Electric Car (EV) is essentially an automatic vehicle with an electric motor powering it. A fully electric car does not run on or have a petrol or diesel engine. With an Electric Car, when you place the car in 'drive' mode, the vehicle accelerates just like an automatic vehicle. There are no gears in electric or hybrid cars. They are all always fully automatic cars. Around 1884, inventor Thomas Parker helped deploy electric-powered trams and built prototype electric cars in England. When the accelerator is pressed, power is transferred from the battery to the electric motor. The motor is powered resulting in the drive shafts turning the wheels. When the car brakes, the car begins to decelerate and the motor becomes an alternator, generating power. This power is then sent back into the battery.</P>
<p>There are several types of electric vehicle (EV) available. Some run purely just on electricity, these are known as Pure Electric Vehicles - aka EVs. With new technologies there are now some electric powered engines that can also be run on petrol or diesel, these are called Hybrid Electric Vehicles - aka Hybrids. Electric vehicles use electricity to charge their batteries instead of using fossil fuels like petrol or diesel. Electric vehicles are more efficient, and that combined with the electricity cost means that charging an electric vehicle is cheaper than filling petrol or diesel for your travel requirements.</p>
<p>Electric cars function by plugging the car into a charge point. Like all electrical devices, it then begins to take electricity from the grid and charge the car. The car stores the electricity in rechargeable batteries that then power an electric motor, which turns the wheels as a normal fuel-engine would. Electric cars accelerate faster than vehicles with traditional fuel engines – so they feel lighter to drive as there are no g. Plugging your electric vehicle or hybrid vehicle in at home is the perfect way to ensure your vehicle is ready when you need it. When on the go, a range of public charge points are available all across the country to go through.  The average speed of an electric car is 110 miles per hour, while top speeds are between 140 and 160 miles per hour.
<p>Electric motors can provide high power-to-weight ratios. Batteries can be designed to supply the electrical current needed to support these motors. Electric motors have a flat torque curve down to zero speed. For simplicity and reliability, most electric cars use fixed-ratio gearboxes and have no clutch. Many electric cars have faster acceleration than average ICE cars, largely due to reduced drivetrain frictional losses and the more quickly-available torque of an electric motor. However, NEVs may have a low acceleration due to their relatively weak motors. Electric vehicles can also use a motor in each wheel hub or next to the wheels, this is rare but claimed to be safer. Electric vehicles that lack an axle, differential, or transmission can have less drivetrain inertia. Some direct current motor-equipped drag racer EVs have simple two-speed manual transmissions to improve top speed. The concept electric supercar Rimac Concept One claims it can go from 0–97 km/h (0–60 mph) in 2.5 seconds. Tesla claims the upcoming Tesla Roadster will go 0–60 mph (0–97 km/h) in 1.9 seconds.</p>
<p>Electric motors are more efficient than internal combustion engines in converting stored energy into driving a vehicle. However, they are not equally efficient at all speeds. To allow for this, some cars with dual electric motors have one electric motor with a gear optimised for city speeds and the second electric motor with a gear optimised for highway speeds. The electronics select the motor that has the best efficiency for the current speed and acceleration. Regenerative braking, which is most common in electric vehicles, can recover as much as one fifth of the energy normally lost during braking.</p>
